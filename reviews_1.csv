  Recieved todayWorth for 2kBut I had one plus wireless bullets 2This one comes no where near that in build quality and premium feeling and sound QualityBut again this product is 4k less.Very light weight to wearBass is good and better that bullets 2.If you have not used bullets 2 then you will be very much satisfied with wireless Z.But anyways I'll use this whole day and if I don't get satisfied then I'm going again for bullets wireless 2 onlyEdit:- after 2 days of extensive use and comparing z with wireless 2 I've come to conclusion that ""Z"" is a steal deal. I'm very much satisfied with it. Nothing is in the market that comes close to ""Z"" in under 2k.You can definitely buy this with your eyes closed.

  Product is just amazing!!With the reasonable price and quality üñ§Unbox - really great feel in Unboxing it!Products included -  C Type red cable and extra pair of earplugs and manualsExperience - One plus products are always amazing, and this earphone tho I really loved it..The quality and the design is really excellent than the wireless 2 earphones!It comes with the magnetic attach, where song will be paused when u attach both ear piece, and I had a confusion in Turing ON the earphones, You need to separate the earplugs and automatically it will be ON and Pair instantly..Sound quality - really great experienceAnd bass is not that good!Volume control will different in this , i.e., when you increase or decrease the volume through earphones ,it doesn't impact on your mobile volume control...

  Hello everyone....this is just a quick review about this headsetI use a OnePlus 7pro, here is what I felt about the headset pairing is easy and smooth Volume is not so high (if you are using a OnePlus device coz the volume bar is common for both headset and phone increase the volume of headset phone volume increases and vise versa) if you connect to any other device you get seperate volume for the device and the headset. If you are a bass lover bass is not that punchy but has excellent sound quality ( try listening to Hello by Adele, it just blowed my mind) Battery backup is awsome (Note: 10mins charge for 10hrs works only if you are using the 30W warp charger) Low latency works only in fnatic mode (only in OnePlus device) Magnetic control works for any devicesThat's what I think about the headset. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

  ‚Ä¢ Takes 40mins to charge (On a OnePlus 7 Warp charger)‚Ä¢ The battery life of the Neckband is Near 20h (Recorded using a phone timer everytime I used it)‚Ä¢ well sounds Great (Background music and vocals) and has a nice base to it too.‚Ä¢ Neckband is made up of smooth rubber feels awesome üëç‚Ä¢ Both ends of the band (Those bulk edges from where the wire comes from) are made up of metal (I don't know whether it's aluminium or steel or something..but it's good and feels durable‚Ä¢ As of recommendation or confusion of buying a Neckband in 2k I prefer these bullets wireless Z won't regret it that's for sure

  I purchased this 1 week ago and got it today. The packaging by OnePlus is superb, better than packing provided by JBL, SkullCandy, etc.Coming to main review-Pros:Sound quality is better than any other wireless headphones in the price range.Build quality is not premium but better than average.The device switching function is great and hassle free.Sound is optimally loud.Battery life and charging time is awesomely fast.Cons:Sound lag while playing games and videos if HD Audio is turned on in Bluetooth Device's Setting. (around  500ms delay)Low latency is just a marketing strategy, you can never feel difference between sound delayswhile fnatic mode on and off.If you are consider using this earphones for playing PUBG or COD an your primary internet is over WiFi, use these only if you have 5ghz band wifi, because bluetooth works over 2.4ghz band that will interfere with your wifi and give you high ping/latency. Also, you will need to turn the HD Audio off in Settings>Bluetooth & Device Connections > Bluetooth > OnePlus WirelessZ to get a least sound lag experience.If they could have provided this earphone with NFC support as well, than this could be a great deal of budget earphones. Now, it is just another pair of bluetooth earphones. When HD Audio is turned on you can literally hear everything in the game, you can tell the opponent position more precisely just by hearing footsteps, but again there will be an audio lag that will be of great loss.

  They are really good have a good quality of soundThey definitely have some bass. The best quality they have is the wrap charge the awesome thing and most of the people will take it for the warp charge and their special features.

  The headphones are good thats my verdict. Everything from packaging to the final product is top notch. The audio quality is good. The battery is great, Cmon 10mins charge 10hrs ‚ù§Ô∏è. The only downside is the part near the eartips is bigger so tends to create pain in your ears. This is personal as others may not feel it as it depends on your ear size..Keeping that aside the product is great.

  Would have been a 5 star rating if not for the slightly poor bass. Boat rockerz have better bass at a lower price but the bullets are a better package overall. Warp charging works brilliantly.

  Earphone is quite good but i have been hearing rumors that its the best under 2K among all but i will say its 60% and 40% fight between realme buds wireless ... because the build quality is almost same but according to me realme looks quite better and the only draw back is with realme that it has Old model type A port charging and 10 hours of backup ... otherwise the bass of realme is better than oneplus nd i m facing one more problem with it that i have to re-connect my device by clicking the switch button in order to use this earphone for call ... because until nd unless you will not do you'll not able to use it for calls.... nd the only thing i like in the earphone that is the Type C charging

  Received the product before date, but did not received the cashback yet. Hopefully i will get it soon as Amazon never did it before.Talking about the product, after 4 days of use the charge is still there. Everyday i used it for more then 5hours still 20% left.About the sound quality its awsome with my oneplus7t, bass is little low  but we have equalizer settings on 7t which controls the sound quality according to your taste.Wires are quite good, i won't say its bad, but could have been better.Overall i can say its a great earphone if you have oneplus phone. It works really great.Just go for it..

  Ok Lemme get this straight through. These pair of earphones is not ideal for listening to music. All these earphones are aimed at is for making you life a lil easier and a lot easier if you have a OnePlus device like me( OnePlus 7 pro in my case). Lemme tell you how1) Awesome battery life. I got it at full charge when I unboxed it it's the third day of my use haven't charged it yet and am still hovering around 30%. I'm pretty sure I used it over 5hrs the past two days and in and around 3 hrs now and it still had 30% charge left. So their claim of 20hrs is kinda true as I fell if I go hard on it today even then I'll get atleast 5hrs more of battery life that would make it in the territory of around 18-19 hrs. Good job OnePlus2)Easy pairing with a OnePlus device as it shows a headsup when you turn on bluetooth of your phone and wake the neckband up with the push of a button on the nack band. As for other devices you have to connect it the old fashioned way and once connected it would connect almost instantly the second time. Thubs up again3) Water, dust and sweat resistant. If you are like me you you swaet a lot don't wory cuz these can take those sweaty time no problem4)Very light weight to wear and you will no find it uncomfortable but after a few hours you would still find it a lil taxing on your ears like any earphones do but still it's better than most other I've tried4)If you have other devices like me then you will love the quick switch it's really handyNow let me tell you who this earphones are not for1) If you wanna play mobile games on any other phone other than OnePlus DONT BUY THIS. CUZ IVE NOTICED SOME LAG IN THE IN GAME SOUNDS, EVEN IF IT'S NOT THAT HIGH THAT YOU CANT PLAY ITS STILL THERE AND YOU WILL NOTICE IT. PEOPLE MIGHT SAY YOU WILL GET USED TO IN TIME, YOU MAY BUT I DIDN'T. ALWAYS GO FOR A WIRED EARPHONES FOR THAT.Well if you have OnePlus device it comes with this fnatic gaming mode so the latancy us remarkably low and very much playable. But that's an exclusive feature so yea.2)If you love listening to music and you need those rich base and lovely vocals and clear mids and highs never buy ANY BLUETOOTH EARPHONES IN THIS PRICE RANGE, ALL OF THEM SOUND GARBAGE COMPARED TO WIRED COUNTERPARTS WITH SAME PRICE. THIS DOESN'T MEAN THE OP BULLETS Z IS BAD BUT IT WAS UNDERWHELMING FOR ME AS I HAVE BEEN USING THE ""Sony MDR XB75AP"" for the past 2 years and I haven't yet found anything that sounds better than those in this price bracket for a long time.SO IF YOU ARE LIKE ME WHO HAS A DECENT PAIR OF WIRED EARPHONES THAT GIVE YOU GREAT SOUND QUALITY BUT WANT THE CONVINCE OF A WIRELESS SOLUTION GO FOR IT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTEDPS: THE SOUND OF THESE GOT BETTER OVER THE 3 DAYS IVE BEEN USING IT, I DON'T KNOW IF ME ADJUSTING TO IT OR IF IT IS THE BURN IN OF EARPHONE THAT OCCURRED IT SOUNDS MUCH BETTER NOW AND YOU WILL BE BETTER OF LISTENING TO MELODIES AND MUSIC WITH BASS JUST ENOUGH TO GIVE THE MUSIC A DEPTH TO THE SONG CUZ FOR THOSE THESE ARE GREAT AND VOCALS AND HIGHS ARE PRETTY WELL BALANCED. YOU DO GET ENOUGH BASE FOR THE SONG BUT NO OVERPOWERING IF YOU ARE INTO THAT THEN GO FOR IT .BUT IF YOU WANNA SPEND THE MONEY TO GET AN EARPHONE THAT SOUNDS BETTER AND DON'T WANT THE FANCY WIRELESS LIFE THEN GO BUY ""SONY MDR XB-55AP, it's of the same price but way better quality of sound.If you are reading this last line km pretty sure you are serious about spending your money so I'll give you one last tip""If you don't have a wired earphone that sounds good then don't spend your money on any wireless earphones in this price bracket you will not be satisfied. Just buy ""Sony MDR-XB55AP @ ‚Çπ2000""Or save up some money and get it's big brother ""SONY MDR-XB75AP @ ‚Çπ3000. YOU WILL NOT REGRET YOUR DECISION.

  Pros:1. Battery life2. Fast changing3.quick connection4. Overall sound quality is good for non bass heavy personCons:1.Bass ( i will give 3/5 for bass untill you push your low to very high and increase bass in EQ you can't fell any bass )Other recommendations:If your only concern is sound quality and you can live refurbished product with 12-13 hours of battery you should go forrefurbished sony WI XB400 it is 200‚Çπ costly but great sound quality.( I am personally using Amazon 3 refurbished item till the date i didn't face any problem).

  I was so excited to use these earphone as the features are attractive in regards to price. Here are my observation and thoughts.Pros :*light weight*Easy pairing (switching between two device is much easy with the help of a button)*Sound quality is Great  but....Bass is decent(don't expect sony XB series, JBL kinda bass ) you can boost bass a bit with the help of equaliser.*Built quality is good. Weight is less.*Battery life is insanely great.Cons :*The 10 min charge 10 hours playback features is available only if u charge this earphone with Oneplus proprietary charger supplied with 1+ phones.* Low latency mode is available in OnePlus phone only.*Bass is good but not great. Dont expect much. Even cheap brand (BOAT,zebronics) 1K  earphone bass is much better from this.*No physical on/off switch. U have to use the magnetic feature to turn this off and on.*Supplied User maannual lacks many details (power input , quick charge features etc*I found this little bit uncomfortable after using for long hours continuously

  Lets start review with prosPros:1. Build quality is top notch.2. Pairing is relatively easy.3. Warp charging WITHOUT ONEPLUS CHARGER is awesome 10 min charge 10 hours battery !!4. Magnetic control is good to pause music.Now coming to consCons:1.The blinking light is really disturbing in dark. It blinks even after pairing with phone. OnePlus I don't need you telling me every 10 seconds that my earphones are paired ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è2. LOW LATENCY MODE doesn't work on other phones except OnePlus 5 and above !!!!!3. Finaly I would say this little gadget is awesome if you have a OnePlus device but it's not well suited for you if your phone doesn't have Bluetooth 5.0 sadly mine is 4.2 !! My advice would be dont get fooled by stars on the product page because the stars are given literally by OnePlus fans and not honest reviewers who aren't biased in their opinion !

  Not for phone calls. When the earphones stick to each other, the headset powers off and disconnects from phone. When the phone rings for incoming call, to answer it on headset, one must first separate the earphones. Then the headset powers on and starts to connect to your phone. All this while your phone keeps ringing. When you start hearing the ring in your earphone and press button to answer the call, the call disconnects. And now you must return the call. If you want to use for taking calls, you will have to ensure that one earphone is always in your ear or fix right earphone somewhere away from left earphone so that they cannot come close, if left hanging, or else they will stick to eachother and power off the headset. Switching between 2 devices is good feature. I have it paired with my OnePlus 7t and my Ipad Pro and just by the button twice, I am able to switch between watching a movie to answering a phone call and back to watching movie on IPad. But the earphones should not disconnect from phone and they are joined magnetically. My main use is for taking calls and I hate a earphone permanently inserted in my ear canal like an earpod or other bluetooth single ear earphone. I had Samsung level U for many years and it also this feature of earphones sticking to each other magnetically but the headset does not disconnect from phone. And since these cannot be returned, I just made a loss of 2000 Rupees :-(

  I am using this for a month now and the Product is really good. Howeverif you are really a Bass Lover, this does not suit you. It does not have good Bass and volume is medium and many of the Products which are cheaper than this provides good Bass and high volume.If you want to use it for more than one device at the same time, it will not automatically switch. There is a button which you need to press it twice to switch from one device to another. If you have paired with more than 2 or 3 devices, then it does confuse and you need to manually connect from your device. You have Samsung Level U / Mulo bluetooth earphones, which automatically switch between devices.If you really play with Magnets of earbuds during when you are idle, this will really mess you up. As power off is through putting two earbuds together. So whenever you separate two earbuds, it turns on and joining the earbuds will turn off. So, please be cautious.Noise Cancellation seems pretty good.It is so flexible and whenever you keep it down, it may just twist the whole earphone.But if you are Brand Lover, then this is the one you need to go for a lower cost.

  Hey I used OnePlus bullet wireless Z neckband earphone.Here I faced the issues‚Ä¢While playing games it strucks and delay(late) sounds.‚Ä¢While playing game automatically error and my team can't hear my voice. (I changed to the my regular earphone then my team can hear me) it happened multiple times.‚Ä¢Also there is no protection for charger port USB CAP (like other brands have it) from sweat and water flash. Am very much worried about this.I used multiple times and I found the issues. My friends also complained multiple times they can't hear my voice while playing game (this issue only while playing game not in calls).

  I received the earphones before time. I was really to receive this pair. The looks and feel of the product is really really premium. The sound quality is equivalent to the Sennheiser CX275 In-Ears, meaning it is above expectation and above the value for money.  The battery back-up is really amazing and gave me an 18 hr backup. It charges real quick, 20 min to full charge.But there are some issues related to this particular earphone which I received: 1. The Bluetooth disconnected in between the call multiple times despite the fact that I was close to my one plus 6t. 2. The buds kinda slip out of my ear, and I found this very disheartening because all the reviews which I saw on youtube kinda portrayed it that it won't slip out of your ear. Even with the slightest walking and having the optimum size of buds in the ear which do not tend to move while I'm sitting, surprisingly slips out of my ear and I have to adjust them again and again.3. The mic is not that great, a lot of people complained that my voice is getting too much surround, and it is too jizzy leaving the listener with a lot of irritation. I kinda got pissed of explaining the same thing 2-3 times to the person other side and I 've to bring the mic really close to my mouth, which would again result in pulling the left bud out of my ear. Heck. At times I have to literally shout to make the other person listen.I don't know whether this problem is with my particular piece, or is it with everyone?

  Received the product yesterday, very quick delivery from Amazon. When I checked the sound quality it's good.BUT when I tried to record and send a voice clip on web.whatsapp and skype, the voice is having a terrible disturbance. Thought it's one time issue, but no, it's there throughout...Also, the noise cancellation too isn't there it seems. I'll be sending this back after testing one or two times...NB: There isn't any issue on call and this is also good for listening, only for this voice-recording party I felt this issue.

  Low Latency on finatic mode is not anything amazing. It still lag like normal wireless headset. So for serious gaming its not anything great. Even it hurts to say,cheaper boat headset offer much wider sound stage. Fast charging is the only true special feature about it. AAC comes as default codec. May be because I was too hyped about it, the experience was disappointing.. If you just want a normal wireless headset with dash charge + great battery life go with it.. anything other than that is pretty average.

  Returned the product on 2nd day.Cons: My foremost reason behind is that I found this in-ear headphones quite uncomfortable for me; causes pain after 40-50 minutes of use. Secondly, the bass is absolutely negligible. I tried to fiddle with equillizer but unfortunately, these are pretty weak on bass.Pros: I use OnePlus 7 & pairing with my mobile is buttery smooth. Build quality is very good. Apart from bass, sound quality is simply impressive; very crisp highs & mids. Charge it once & forget about the battery. Used them for +7 hours & the battery was still 80% left.

  Amazon was timely with their delivery, no snags, was delivered early.Im currently using a OnePlus 5.First impressions were great. But after a few days the left earpiece started to show signs of degredation. There seemed to be a slight muddiness in the sound. The left ear also could not isolate sounds as well as the right ear and so it was uncomfortable to use - I had to adjust by pressing the earpiece farther into my ear canal.Other things :1. The battery backup is amazing. Due to Lockdown, I've been using these headphones for atleast 8hours a day, and yes, the advertised 20hrs seems to be correct. Also the charging speed is honestly amazing - again, the advertised 10min does equate to 10hrs of listening. The device charged to 100% in half an hour.2. Bass was adequate for me, I'm not an audiophile or a basshead.3. The device is light weight, and does not irritate the skin in any way.I had high hopes for this OnePlus release, but they let me down. I'm gonna return this and buy another pair of headphones.

  The earphones build quality is great, loved it and also i liked the color and audio qualityThe only problem i encountered on the unit i have received was the left earbud was falling off the ear no matter now good i try to adjust or fit it inside even after trying to change the eartips provided with the productAnother issue was low battery life, i only got maximum of 8 to 9 hours of battery backup after testing it for 3 consecutive full charges.

  Today I got delivery, thanks to Amazon for quick delivery in such trouble time... sound and mic problem only 1 star because not expected such low level sound quality.. Mic problem is that you have to speak louder and have to bring mic towards your mouth to get audible on other side. If you are looking for better quality of sound just go for others. It waste of money to buy these headsets for all including calls, musics and games.

  It collects all the outside noise and is very poor in terms of voice calling. Only good for music. Person on the other hand can't hear you because of the wind noise even from the fan. Worst product. Don't go with the brand name. It's a very poor product. Being a Bluetooth earphone you can't use it while riding your bike or scooter because it catches only wind noise. A earphone's main purpose is to help in hearing, but this is a worst product. Dear OnePlus, only big battery life doesn't make it a good product.
